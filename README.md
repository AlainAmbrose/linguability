## Inspiration
**Linguability** was inspired by the desire to make language learning _seamless_ and _pressure-free_. We aimed to create something that helps people learn a new language without interrupting their flowâ€”just casual, consistent exposure to new words and phrases while browsing the web.

## What it does
**Linguability** is a Chrome extension that helps you learn a new language without breaking your browsing flow. As you visit websites, it randomly translates sentences into your target languageâ€”Spanish or French, for now, ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·â€”based on your chosen difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced).

## How we built it
**Linguability** was developed with _JavaScript_, _HTML_, and _CSS_  to create a seamless Chrome extension. The extension harnesses _Generative AI_, utilizing AI for accurate and contextually appropriate translations, enhancing the learning experience.

## Challenges we ran into
One major hurdle was managing two DOMs: the Linguability UI and the user's current webpage. This required careful navigation to avoid security risks and confusion in how the elements interacted.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have much to be proud of including the effective integration of _Generative AI_ relevant translations, enhancing the user experience. Ultimately we are proud that **Linguability** provides a non-invasive way for users to casually learn a new language.

## What we learned
The experience of integrating Generative AI for translations deepened our understanding of prompt design and engineering, along with its practical applications in language processing. Overall, the project improved our technical skills and reinforced the value of communication and teamwork.

## What's next for **Linguability**
The next steps for **Linguability** could involve expanding features by introducing support for additional languages and implementing progress tracking. With these initiatives, we could create an even more powerful tool that supports users in their language-learning journey while keeping the experience fun and engaging! ðŸŽ‰
